        I studied Business Administration and worked as an Administrative
        Assistant for a few years. In 2016, I moved to London and lived there
        until 2021. It was a great experience and a daily challenge. There, I
        worked as a barista at Starbucks until I had my first child. After
        dedicating a few years to my family, last year I decided that I wanted
        to embark on something new, have a challenge in mind, and do something
        different from what I had known until then. I decided to study Web
        Programming and enrolled in a bootcamp at Adalab. It has been a tough
        journey, but I am starting to be proud of the small steps I am taking
